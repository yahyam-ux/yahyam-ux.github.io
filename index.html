I modeled a Porsche 911 entirely in Fusion 360 using mesh-style modeling. I began by saving, cropping, and scaling the blueprints into Fusion 360 to use as a reference. Starting with the side profile, I created a reference for the car's body. From there, I extruded various parts using the blueprints as rough guidelines. I ensured the smooth display of the car matched the general shape, using uniformity checks, repair bodies, and zebra analysis to verify the accuracy of the contours. By gradually editing the car's surface, extruding, and adding points or edges, I shaped the overall design. Once the body was completed, I imported the wheels into the model and began splitting and trimming the body to create the outlines for the windows, door glass, and spoiler. Finally, I rendered the model and added color. This entire process was based on a tutorial from this YouTube video.

            <h2>Engine Model</h2>
            <p>I modeled a piston and crank engine entirely in Fusion 360. Although it is an animated body, I cannot showcase the movement directly on this website.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
               The engine was created using a combination of pistons, cranks, and connectors, which were assembled using joints. By adding a pulley, the result is a basic but functional engine model.

            <p>Finally, I developed a simulation showcasing physics in a 3D plane. This simulation incorporates data from an external website to enhance the graphics. I customized various aspects of the animation to modify the simulation's behavior.</p>
